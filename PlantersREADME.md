# Planters
Julia has n house plants, in planters of different sizes. The plants have grown quite a bit and each needs to be replanted in a larger planter. So Julia sets to work. She buys m extra planters, and now she is ready to start replanting. Once she moves a plant to a larger planter, the original planter can be reused for another plant. But wait! Is it possible to replant the plants so that each gets a larger planter? Design an O((m + n) log(m + n)) algorithm that determines whether it is possible to replant the plants so that each gets a larger planter than it had initially.
