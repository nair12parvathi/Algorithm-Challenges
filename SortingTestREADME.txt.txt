Sorting Test:

This problem asks you to compare several algorithms for the same problem. The problem has multiple parts: • Implement MergeSort, InsertionSort and BucketSort. • Test the algorithms on random floating point numbers with a uniform distribution in the range [0, 1). Test on input of size n = 10, n = 100, n = 1000, n = 10000, n = 100000, and n = 1000000. • Test the algorithms on random floating point numbers with a Gaussian (normal) distribution with µ = 0.5 and s = 1 10000 . (You should clip these values to stay in the range [0, 1), but in practice this will be unnecessary, as the probability of a value being generated outside this range will be essentially 0.) Test on input of size n = 10, n = 100, n = 1000, n = 10000, n = 100000, and n = 1000000. • Compare the running times of the three algorithms across all different inputs. Do not include the time required to read input or write output in your calculations


Input specification: There is no input specification for this problem. 

Output specification: There is no output specification for this problem. When run, your code should run each sorting algorithm for at least one of the inputs, and output the timing results for each sorting algorithm. The output does not need to be in any particular format.
