Evensum:

Write a program that reads in a series of non-negative integers and prints out the sum of all inputs that are even. The first line of the input will be the number, n, of integers that comprise the input (do not include this number in your sum!). This will be followed by n input lines, each line containing a single number. The output should simply be the resulting sum and nothing else. The number of integers and the result will fit in int.
