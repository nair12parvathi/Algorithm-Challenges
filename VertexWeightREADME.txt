We say that an undirected graph G = (V, E) is positive-vertex-weighted if we have a positive weight function w on G’s vertices, i.e., w : V ? R+. Give an O(n 2 ) algorithm for the single-source shortest path problem on positive-vertex-weighted undirected graphs. Note that the weight of a path is the sum of the weights of the nodes that comprise the path, including the start and destination nodes.
